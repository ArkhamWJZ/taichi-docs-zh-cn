"The Taichi compiler backend is under migration from source-to-source "
"compilation to LLVM for compilation speed and portability. Sparse "
"computation with the new LLVM backend is not yet fully implemented on "

"The legacy source-to-source backend (commit ``dc162e11``) provides full "
"sparse computation functionality. However, since little engineering has "
"been done to make that commit portable (i.e. easy to compile on different"
" platforms), we suggest waiting until the LLVM version of sparse "
"computation is fully implemented."
